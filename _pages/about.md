We go by the name MICS /mÉªks/ Lab, pronounced as "MIX". Like the name, our lab's focus is a MIX of fields, spanning from 'Medical' and 'Microwave' to 'Innovative Circuits' and 'Sensors'. Whichever way you want to name it!

If you're driven by a strong passion for a specific research area and could use some assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.
