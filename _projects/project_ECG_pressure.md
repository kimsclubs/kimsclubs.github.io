We develop device for `wearable`, `portable` ECG, EMG, EEG measurement. This includes electrical measurement circuit and electrode fabrication. Various physiological signals for biomedical applications are investigated. <br> <br>Also, we work to integrate `Machine Learning algorithm` for realtime arrhythmia, QRS detection and blood pressure estimation.
