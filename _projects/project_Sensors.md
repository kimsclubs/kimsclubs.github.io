We are currently researching nanostructured biosensors with the objective of creating a range of sensors capable of detecting diverse conditions such as glucose levels, cancer indicators, and stroke markers. In conjunction with this, we are also working on the development of compact measurement circuits and systems. These miniaturized setups are designed to enhance usability in real-world scenarios.
